# Bachelor Thesis

This thesis investigates how Reactive Programming is beneficial for creating reactive abstractions
to facilitate STEAM learning activities and robotics. The DJI Tello EDU drone served as our case
study. Different reactive languages/libraries have been investigated from both an academic and
an industrial perspective. We investigated the given SDK and the different official libraries of our
case study. To design our own reactive library for the Tello drone, we opted to focus on the
mainstream reactive framework RxJS. The imperative approaches utilizing the provided libraries
were compared to our reactive approach. We concluded that the reactive approach abstracts
different difficult concepts. Reactive abstractions are powerful in expressing how to react to incoming
data without adding an extra burden to the programmer.
